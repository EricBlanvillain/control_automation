Forest Inc. - Annual Responsibility Report 2023 (Excerpt)

Environmental Stewardship:
We are committed to minimizing our environmental footprint. In 2023, we successfully reduced water usage across our main logging sites by 15% through implementing new recycling techniques. Our replanting program exceeded targets, planting 1.2 million saplings. However, our Scope 3 emissions related to transportation saw a slight increase due to expanded operations, an area we are actively addressing with logistics partners.

Social Responsibility:
Employee wellbeing remains a priority. We launched the "Healthy Habitat" initiative, providing enhanced mental health support resources and flexible working arrangements, resulting in a 10% decrease in reported stress levels. We contributed over 500 volunteer hours to local community projects focused on river cleanup and habitat restoration.

Governance:
Our board maintains strong oversight of ESG matters. Executive compensation is now partially linked to achieving sustainability targets.
